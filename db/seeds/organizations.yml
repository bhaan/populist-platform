  description: ProgressivePunch.org is a privately-owned website. By providing information on a broad range of issues deliberated by Congress and applying a progressive analysis to the votes cast, ProgressivePunch wants to raise public consciousness by highlighting progressive votes and exposing non-progressive votes. It also hopes to influence the future voting patterns of legislators, not only by making their votes visible and transparent, but also – as we build the website – by facilitating the transmission of messages from the public to these legislators, thanking them for good votes, chastising them for bad votes, and calling upon them to "do the right thing" as future votes arise.
