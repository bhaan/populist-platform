# Reference HTML Data

The HTML files listed in this directory are intended for offline testing and historical reference. In the case that a webpage changes its structure in the future, these files can be referenced to help understand how the HTML structure changed by comparing it with the official source HTML.

If the HTML structure does change for a given webpage, the HTML files in this directory should be updated in conjunction with any code changes needed for the scrapers.
